# AWS Cloudtrail

## Exam tips

- You can validate the integrity of AWS CloudTrail log files and detect whether the log files were unchanged, modified, or deleted since CloudTrail delivered them to your Amazon S3 bucket. With a validated log file, you can assert positively that the log file itself has not changed, or that particular user credentials performed specific API activity. The CloudTrail log file integrity validation process also informs you if a log file has been deleted or changed. You gain the insight to assert positively that log files either were delivered or were not delivered to your account during a given period of time. You can [activate log file integrity validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-log-file-validation-enabling.html) with the CloudTrail console when you create or update a trail.
