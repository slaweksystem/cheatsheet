Amazon Elastic File system - provides file storage for use with your EC2 instances.

__Exam Tip:__ - The security groups that you [associate with a mount target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs-create-security-groups.html) must allow inbound access for the TCP protocol on the NFS port from the security group used by the instances.
